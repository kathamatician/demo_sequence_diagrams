title aw4null project target flow to generate training data

actor user
participant Car
participant OmnAIScopes
participant VCDS
participant "VCDS app" as VCDSApp
participant "OmnAIView app" as OmnAIView
participant "filesystem (user laptop)" as Filesystem
participant hub
participant "THGA storage" as THGA

== Setup Phase ==
user -> Car : connect OmnAIScopes
user -> Car : connect VCDS

== Initialization ==
user -> VCDSApp : open VCDS app
user -> OmnAIView : open OmnAIView app

== Measurement ==
user -> OmnAIView : start measurement via UI
OmnAIScopes -> OmnAIView : send sensor data via USB
VCDS -> VCDSApp : send diagnostic data

== Upload Trigger ==
user -> OmnAIView : trigger upload of OmnAIScopes + VCDS data

== Visualization ==
VCDSApp -> user : show error codes
user -> VCDSApp : export VCDS data
VCDSApp -> Filesystem : save VCDS data

OmnAIView -> user : show sensor waveforms
OmnAIView -> hub : upload all data to hub

== Server Side Processing ==
hub -> hub : process diagnostic + waveform data
hub -> THGA : forward processed data

== Response to Client ==
hub -> OmnAIView : send success/failure
OmnAIView -> user : display upload result

== Model Training ==
hub -> THGA : train model using stored data
