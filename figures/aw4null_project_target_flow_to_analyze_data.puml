title aw4null project target flow to analyze data

actor user
participant Car
participant OmnAIScopes
participant VCDS
participant "VCDS app" as VCDSApp
participant "OmnAIView app" as OmnAIView
participant "filesystem (user laptop)" as Filesystem
participant hub
participant "THGA storage" as THGA

== Setup Phase ==
user -> Car : connect OmnAIScopes
user -> Car : connect VCDS

== Initialization ==
user -> VCDSApp : open VCDS app
user -> OmnAIView : open OmnAIView app

== Measurement ==
user -> OmnAIView : start measurement via UI
OmnAIScopes -> OmnAIView : send sensor data via USB
VCDS -> VCDSApp : send diagnostic data

== Data Export ==
VCDSApp -> user : visualize error codes
user -> VCDSApp : export VCDS data
VCDSApp -> Filesystem : save VCDS data
OmnAIView -> user : visualize scope data

== Upload ==
user -> OmnAIView : trigger upload of OmnAIScopes + VCDS data
OmnAIView -> hub : upload data to hub server

== Server Processing ==
hub -> hub : process data
alt success
    hub -> OmnAIView : send success message
else failure
    hub -> OmnAIView : send failure message
end

== Analysis ==
hub -> THGA : load trained model
hub -> hub : analyze uploaded data with model
hub -> OmnAIView : return diagnostic result
OmnAIView -> user : show results
